    },
    {
        "question": "What is encapsulation in OOP?",
        "answer": "Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does encapsulation improve code security?",
        "answer": "Encapsulation restricts direct access to an object's data, allowing controlled access via public methods, which helps prevent unintended or unauthorized modifications."

    {
        "question": "What is inheritance in OOP?",
        "answer": "Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (subclass or child class) inherits properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) from another class (superclass or parent class)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is single inheritance?",
        "answer": "Single inheritance is when a class inherits from only one parent class, meaning it derives properties and behaviors from just one superclass."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is multiple inheritance and how is it handled in languages like Python?",
        "answer": "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one superclass. Python supports multiple inheritance, but languages like Java avoid it with classes and instead allow it through interfaces."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the diamond problem in multiple inheritance?",
        "answer": "The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from the same base class, leading to ambiguity over which class’s properties/methods should be used. This is resolved using method resolution order (MRO) in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is polymorphism in OOP?",
        "answer": "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, enabling methods to behave differently based on the object they are acting upon."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is method overriding in OOP?",
        "answer": "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass, allowing for runtime polymorphism."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is method overloading?",
        "answer": "Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. This provides compile-time polymorphism, allowing a method to perform different actions based on input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is abstraction in OOP?",
        "answer": "Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features or functionality to the user."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is abstraction achieved in OOP?",
        "answer": "Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class can have abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses, while an interface provides a contract that implementing classes must follow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an interface in OOP?",
        "answer": "An interface is a collection of abstract methods that defines a contract for classes. Any class that implements the interface must provide implementations for the methods declared in the interface."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?",
        "answer": "An abstract class can have both abstract and fully implemented methods, while an interface only contains abstract methods (though modern languages like Java allow default methods in interfaces). A class can implement multiple interfaces but inherit from only one abstract class."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'super' keyword in OOP?",
        "answer": "The 'super' keyword is used in a subclass to refer to its immediate parent class. It can be used to access the parent class's methods and constructors."

    {
        "question": "What is a constructor in OOP?",
        "answer": "A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. It is used to initialize object attributes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is constructor overloading?",
        "answer": "Constructor overloading allows a class to have more than one constructor, each with different parameter lists, so that objects can be initialized in multiple ways."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a destructor in OOP?",
        "answer": "A destructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object is destroyed. It is used to release resources that the object was holding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is 'this' keyword in OOP?",
        "answer": "The 'this' keyword refers to the current instance of a class. It is used to access class members and differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is operator overloading in OOP?",
        "answer": "Operator overloading allows you to define or redefine how operators (like +, -, *, etc.) work for user-defined data types, enabling intuitive usage of objects in expressions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between association, aggregation, and composition?",
        "answer": "Association refers to a relationship between two objects. Aggregation is a special form of association where one object 'owns' another but both can exist independently. Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where the lifecycle of the owned object depends on the owner."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is object cloning in OOP?",
        "answer": "Object cloning is the process of creating an exact copy of an object. In Java, this is done using the clone() method, which creates a new object with the same values as the original."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is deep cloning vs shallow cloning?",
        "answer": "Shallow cloning creates a new object but copies references to nested objects, while deep cloning creates new instances of nested objects, ensuring that changes in the cloned object don’t affect the original."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is 'instanceof' keyword in OOP?",
        "answer": "The 'instanceof' keyword checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass, returning true if the object is of the specified type."
