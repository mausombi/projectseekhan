# Project title: 
Interactive Learning Quiz Generator

# Project Objective:
Develop a tool that automatically generates interactive quizzes based on userprovided topics or text using Generative AI (GenAI). This tool aims to enhance
learning by creating custom quizzes that help users test their knowledge and
reinforce their understanding of the material.

# Project Overview:
Quizzes are a proven method for reinforcing learning, but creating them
manually can be time-consuming. This project leverages GenAI to automatically
generate quizzes tailored to specific topics, chapters, or documents. Users input
a topic, a piece of text, or select a subject area, and the system generates a
quiz with various question types, including multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-theblank, and short answer questions.
