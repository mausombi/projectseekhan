Recursion\\nOne way to describe repetition within a computer program is the use of loops,\\nsuch as Java’s while -loop and for-loop constructs described in Section 1.5.2. An\\nentirely different way to achieve repetition is through a process known as recursion .\\nRecursion is a technique by which a method makes one or more calls to itself\\nduring execution, or by which a data structure relies upon smaller instances of\\nthe very same type of structure in its representation. There are many examples ofrecursion in art and nature. For example, fractal patterns are naturally recursive. Aphysical example of recursion used in art is in the Russian Matryoshka dolls. Each\\ndoll is either made of solid wood, or is hollow and contains another Matryoshka\\ndoll inside it.\\nIn computing, recursion provides an elegant and powerful alternative for per-\\nforming repetitive tasks. In fact, a few programming languages (e.g., Scheme,Smalltalk) do not explicitly support looping constructs and instead rely directlyon recursion to express repetition. Most modern programming languages supportfunctional recursion using the identical mechanism that is used to support tradi-\\ntional forms of method calls. When one invocation of the method makes a recursive\\ncall, that invocation is suspended until the recursive call completes.\\nRecursion is an important technique in the study of data structures and algo-\\nrithms. We will use it prominently in several later chapters of this book (mostnotably, Chapters 8 and 12). In this chapter, we begin with the following four illus-trative examples of the use of recursion, providing a Java implementation for each.\\n•The factorial function (commonly denoted as n!) is a classic mathematical\\nfunction that has a natural recursive deﬁnition.\\n•An English ruler has a recursive pattern that is a simple example of a fractal\\nstructure.\\n•Binary search is among the most important computer algorithms. It allows\\nus to efﬁciently locate a desired value in a data set with upwards of billionsof entries.\\n•The ﬁle system for a computer has a recursive structure in which directories\\ncan be nested arbitrarily deeply within other directories. Recursive algo-\\nrithms are widely used to explore and manage these ﬁle systems.\\nWe then describe how to perform a formal analysis of the running time of a\\nrecursive algorithm, and we discuss some potential pitfalls when deﬁning recur-sions. In the balance of the chapter, we provide many more examples of recursive\\nalgorithms, organized to highlight some common forms of design.\\nwww.it-ebooks.info'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='5.1. Illustrative Examples 191\\n5.1 Illustrative Examples\\n5.1.1 The Factorial Function\\nTo demonstrate the mechanics of recursion, we begin with a simple mathematical\\nexample of computing the value of the factorial function . The factorial of a posi-\\ntive integer n, denoted n!, is deﬁned as the product of the integers from 1 to n.I f\\nn=0, then n! is deﬁned as 1 by convention. More formally, for any integer n≥0,\\nn!=/braceleftbigg1i f n=0\\nn·(n−1)·(n−2)···3·2·1i f n≥1.\\nFor example, 5! =5·4·3·2·1=120. The factorial function is important because\\nit is known to equal the number of ways in which ndistinct items can be arranged\\ninto a sequence, that is, the number of permutations ofnitems. For example, the\\nthree characters a,b,a n d ccan be arranged in 3! =3·2·1=6 ways: abc ,acb ,\\nbac ,bca ,cab ,a n d cba .\\nThere is a natural recursive deﬁnition for the factorial function. To see this,\\nobserve that 5! =5·(4·3·2·1)= 5·4!. More generally, for a positive integer n,\\nwe can deﬁne n!t ob e n·(n−1)!. This recursive deﬁnition can be formalized as\\nn!=/braceleftbigg1i f n=0\\nn·(n−1)!i f n≥1.\\nThis deﬁnition is typical of many recursive deﬁnitions of functions. First, we\\nhave one or more base cases , which refer to ﬁxed values of the function. The above\\ndeﬁnition has one base case stating that n!=1f o r n=0. Second, we have one\\nor more recursive cases , which deﬁne the function in terms of itself. In the above\\ndeﬁnition, there is one recursive case, which indicates that n!=n·(n−1)!f o r n≥1.\\nA Recursive Implementation of the Factorial Function\\nRecursion is not just a mathematical notation; we can use recursion to design a Java\\nimplementation of the factorial function, as shown in Code Fragment 5.1.\\n1public static int factorial( intn)throwsIllegalArgumentException {\\n2 if(n<0)\\n3 throw new IllegalArgumentException(); // argument must be nonnegative\\n4 else if(n == 0)\\n5 return1; // base case\\n6 else\\n7 returnn∗factorial(n −1); // recursive case\\n8}\\nCode Fragment 5.1: A recursive implementation of the factorial function.\\nwww.it-ebooks.info'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='192 Chapter 5. Recursion\\nThis method does not use any explicit loops. Repetition is achieved through\\nrepeated recursive invocations of the method. The process is ﬁnite because each\\ntime the method is invoked, its argument is smaller by one, and when a base case\\nis reached, no further recursive calls are made.\\nWe illustrate the execution of a recursive method using a recursion trace . Each\\nentry of the trace corresponds to a recursive call. Each new recursive method call\\nis indicated by a downward arrow to a new invocation. When the method returns,an arrow showing this return is drawn and the return value may be indicated along-side this arrow. An example of such a trace for the factorial function is shown in\\nFigure 5.1.\\nreturn4∗6=2 4\\nfactorial(1)\\nfactorial(0)factorial(3)\\nfactorial(2)factorial(5)\\nfactorial(4)\\nreturn1return1∗1=1return2∗1=2return3∗2=6return5∗24 = 120\\nFigure 5.1: A recursion trace for the call factorial(5) .\\nA recursion trace closely mirrors a programming language’s execution of the\\nrecursion. In Java, each time a method (recursive or otherwise) is called, a structureknown as an activation record oractivation frame is created to store information\\nabout the progress of that invocation of the method. This frame stores the parame-\\nters and local variables speciﬁc to a given call of the method, and information about\\nwhich command in the body of the method is currently executing.\\nWhen the execution of a method leads to a nested method call, the execution\\nof the former call is suspended and its frame stores the place in the source code at\\nwhich the ﬂow of control should continue upon return of the nested call. A newframe is then created for the nested method call. This process is used both in thestandard case of one method calling a different method, or in the recursive casewhere a method invokes itself. The key point is to have a separate frame for each\\nactive call.\\nwww.it-ebooks.info'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='5.1. Illustrative Examples 193\\n5.1.2 Drawing an English Ruler\\nIn the case of computing the factorial function, there is no compelling reason for\\npreferring recursion over a direct iteration with a loop. As a more complex example\\nof the use of recursion, consider how to draw the markings of a typical English\\nruler. For each inch, we place a tick with a numeric label. We denote the lengthof the tick designating a whole inch as the major tick length . Between the marks\\nfor whole inches, the ruler contains a series of minor ticks , placed at intervals of\\n1/2 inch, 1 /4 inch, and so on. As the size of the interval decreases by half, the tick\\nlength decreases by one. Figure 5.2 demonstrates several such rulers with varying\\nmajor tick lengths (although not drawn to scale).\\n---- 0 ----- 0 --- 0----- -- -----\\n--- --- --- 1\\n---\\n-- -- --\\n---\\n---- 1 ---- --- 2\\n---\\n-- -- -----\\n--- --- --- 3\\n--\\n-- --\\n--\\n---- 2 ----- 1\\n(a) (b) (c)\\nFigure 5.2: Three sample outputs of an English ruler drawing: (a) a 2-inch ruler\\nwith major tick length 4; (b) a 1-inch ruler with major tick length 5; (c) a 3-inchruler with major tick length 3.\\nA Recursive Approach to Ruler Drawing\\nThe English ruler pattern is a simple example of a fractal , that is, a shape that has\\na self-recursive structure at various levels of magniﬁcation. Consider the rule withmajor tick length 5 shown in Figure 5.2(b). Ignoring the lines containing 0 and 1,let us consider how to draw the sequence of ticks lying between these lines. Thecentral tick (at 1/2 inch) has length 4. Observe that the two patterns of ticks above\\nand below this central tick are identical, and each has a central tick of length 3.\\nwww.it-ebooks.info'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='194 Chapter 5. Recursion\\nIn general, an interval with a central tick length L≥1 is composed of:\\n•An interval with a central tick length L−1\\n•A single tick of length L\\n•An interval with a central tick length L−1\\nAlthough it is possible to draw such a ruler using an iterative process (see Ex-\\nercise P-5.29), the task is considerably easier to accomplish with recursion. Our\\nimplementation consists of three methods, as shown in Code Fragment 5.2.\\nThe main method, drawRuler , manages the construction of the entire ruler. Its\\narguments specify the total number of inches in the ruler and the major tick length.The utility method, drawLine , draws a single tick with a speciﬁed number of dashes\\n(and an optional integer label that is printed to the right of the tick).\\nThe interesting work is done by the recursive drawInterval method. This method\\ndraws the sequence of minor ticks within some interval, based upon the length ofthe interval’s central tick. We rely on the intuition shown at the top of this page,and with a base case when L=0 that draws nothing. For L≥1, the ﬁrst and last\\nsteps are performed by recursively calling drawInterval( L−1). The middle step is\\nperformed by calling method drawLine( L).\\n1/∗∗Draws an English ruler for the given number of inches and major tick length. ∗/\\n2public static void drawRuler( intnInches, intmajorLength) {\\n3drawLine(majorLength, 0); // draw inch 0 line and label\\n4 for(intj=1 ;j <= nInches; j++) {\\n5drawInterval(majorLength −1); // draw interior ticks for inch\\n6drawLine(majorLength, j); // draw inch j line and label\\n7}\\n8}\\n9private static void drawInterval( intcentralLength) {\\n10 if(centralLength >=1 ){ // otherwise, do nothing\\n11drawInterval(centralLength −1); // recursively draw top interval\\n12drawLine(centralLength); // draw center tick line (without label)\\n13drawInterval(centralLength −1); // recursively draw bottom interval\\n14}\\n15}\\n16 private static void drawLine( inttickLength, inttickLabel) {\\n17 for(intj=0 ;j <tickLength; j++)\\n18System.out.print( \"-\");\\n19 if(tickLabel >=0 )\\n20System.out.print( \"\"+ tickLabel);\\n21System.out.print( \"\\\\n\");\\n22}\\n23/∗∗Draws a line with the given tick length (but no label). ∗/\\n24 private static void drawLine( inttickLength) {\\n25drawLine(tickLength, −1);\\n26}\\nCode Fragment 5.2: A recursive implementation of a method that draws a ruler.\\nwww.it-ebooks.info'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='5.1. Illustrative Examples 195\\nIllustrating Ruler Drawing Using a Recursion Trace\\nThe execution of the recursive drawInterval method can be visualized using a re-\\ncursion trace. The trace for drawInterval is more complicated than in the factorial\\nexample, however, because each instance makes two recursive calls. To illustratethis, we will show the recursion trace in a form that is reminiscent of an outline for\\na document.

Recursion\\n5.1.3 Binary Search\\nIn this section, we describe a classic recursive algorithm, binary search , used to\\nefﬁciently locate a target value within a sorted sequence of nelements stored in\\nan array. This is among the most important of computer algorithms, and it is the\\nreason that we so often store data in sorted order (as in Figure 5.4).\\n375 01234 6789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5\\n9 24578 1 2 1 4 1 7 1 9 2 2 2 5 2 7 2 8 3 3\\nFigure 5.4: Values stored in sorted order within an array. The numbers at top are\\nthe indices.\\nWhen the sequence is unsorted , the standard approach to search for a target\\nvalue is to use a loop to examine every element, until either ﬁnding the target orexhausting the data set. This algorithm is known as linear search ,o r sequential\\nsearch , and it runs in O(n)time (i.e., linear time) since every element is inspected\\nin the worst case.\\nWhen the sequence is sorted and indexable , there is a more efﬁcient algorithm.\\n(For intuition, think about how you would accomplish this task by hand!) If weconsider an arbitrary element of the sequence with value v, we can be sure that all\\nelements prior to that in the sequence have values less than or equal to v, and that all\\nelements after that element in the sequence have values greater than or equal to v.\\nThis observation allows us to quickly “home in” on a search target using a variantof the children’s game “high-low.” We call an element of the sequence a candidate\\nif, at the current stage of the search, we cannot rule out that this item matches the\\ntarget. The algorithm maintains two parameters, low andhigh , such that all the\\ncandidate elements have index at least low and at most high . Initially, low=0a n d\\nhigh =n−1.

Namely, a ﬁle system consists of a top-level directory, and thecontents of this directory consists of ﬁles and other directories, which in turn can\\ncontain ﬁles and other directories, and so on. The operating system allows directo-\\nries to be nested arbitrarily deeply (as long as there is enough memory), althoughby necessity there must be some base directories that contain only ﬁles, not fur-ther subdirectories.

Inthis section, we consider one such algorithm: computing the total disk usage for all\\nﬁles and directories nested within a particular directory.\\nFor illustration, Figure 5.7 portrays the disk space being used by all entries in\\nour sample ﬁle system.

Recursion\\n5.2 Analyzing Recursive Algorithms\\nIn Chapter 4, we introduced mathematical techniques for analyzing the efﬁciency\\nof an algorithm, based upon an estimate of the number of primitive operations that\\nare executed by the algorithm. We use notations such as big-Oh to summarize therelationship between the number of operations and the input size for a problem. Inthis section, we demonstrate how to perform this type of running-time analysis torecursive algorithms.\\nWith a recursive algorithm, we will account for each operation that is performed\\nbased upon the particular activation of the method that manages the ﬂow of control\\nat the time it is executed. Stated another way, for each invocation of the method,we only account for the number of operations that are performed within the body ofthat activation. We can then account for the overall number of operations that are\\nexecuted as part of the recursive algorithm by taking the sum, over all activations,\\nof the number of operations that take place during each individual activation. (Asan aside, this is also the way we analyze a nonrecursive method that calls othermethods from within its body.)\\nTo demonstrate this style of analysis, we revisit the four recursive algorithms\\npresented in Sections 5.1.1 through 5.1.4: factorial computation, drawing an En-\\nglish ruler, binary search, and computation of the cumulative size of a ﬁle system.In general, we may rely on the intuition afforded by a recursion trace in recogniz-\\ning how many recursive activations occur, and how the parameterization of each\\nactivation can be used to estimate the number of primitive operations that occur\\nwithin the body of that activation. However, each of these recursive algorithms hasa unique structure and form.\\nComputing Factorials\\nIt is relatively easy to analyze the efﬁciency of our method for computing factorials,as described in Section 5.1.1. A sample recursion trace for our factorial method was\\ngiven in Figure 5.1. To compute factorial(n) , we see that there are a total of n+1\\nactivations, as the parameter decreases from nin the ﬁrst call, to n−1 in the second\\ncall, and so on, until reaching the base case with parameter 0.\\nIt is also clear, given an examination of the method body in Code Fragment 5.1,\\nthat each individual activation of factorial executes a constant number of opera-\\ntions. Therefore, we conclude that the overall number of operations for computing\\nfactorial(n) isO(n),a st h e r ea r e n+1 activations, each of which accounts for O(1)\\noperations.\\nwww.it-ebooks.info'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='5.2. Analyzing Recursive Algorithms 203\\nDrawing an English Ruler\\nIn analyzing the English ruler application from Section 5.1.2, we consider the fun-\\ndamental question of how many total lines of output are generated by an initial call\\ntodrawInterval( c),w h e r e cdenotes the center length. This is a reasonable bench-\\nmark for the overall efﬁciency of the algorithm as each line of output is based upona call to the drawLine utility, and each recursive call to drawInterval with nonzero\\nparameter makes exactly one direct call to drawLine .\\nSome intuition may be gained by examining the source code and the recur-\\nsion trace. We know that a call to drawInterval( c)for c>0 spawns two calls to\\ndrawInterval( c−1)and a single call to drawLine . We will rely on this intuition to\\nprove the following claim.\\nProposition 5.1: For c≥0, a call to drawInterval( c)results in precisely 2c−1\\nlines of output.\\nJustiﬁcation: We provide a formal proof of this claim by induction (see Sec-\\ntion 4.4.3). In fact, induction is a natural mathematical technique for proving the\\ncorrectness and efﬁciency of a recursive process. In the case of the ruler, we note\\nthat an application of drawInterval( 0)generates no output, and that 20−1=1−1=\\n0. This serves as a base case for our claim.\\nMore generally, the number of lines printed by drawInterval( c)is one more\\nthan twice the number generated by a call to drawInterval( c−1), as one center line\\nis printed between two such recursive calls. By induction, we have that the numberof lines is thus 1 +2·(2\\nc−1−1)= 1+2c−2=2c−1.\\nThis proof is indicative of a more mathematically rigorous tool, known as a\\nrecurrence equation , that can be used to analyze the running time of a recursive\\nalgorithm. That technique is discussed in Section 12.1.4, in the context of recursivesorting algorithms.\\nPerforming a Binary Search\\nWhen considering the running time of the binary search algorithm, as presentedin Section 5.1.3, we observe that a constant number of primitive operations areexecuted during each recursive call of the binary search method. Hence, the runningtime is proportional to the number of recursive calls performed. We will show thatat most⌊logn⌋+1 recursive calls are made during a binary search of a sequence\\nhaving nelements, leading to the following claim.\\nProposition 5.2: The binary search algorithm runs in O(logn)time for a sorted\\narray with nelements.\\nwww.it-ebooks.info'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='204 Chapter 5. Recursion\\nJustiﬁcation: To prove this claim, a crucial fact is that with each recursive call\\nthe number of candidate elements still to be searched is given by the value\\nhigh−low+1.\\nMoreover, the number of remaining candidates is reduced by at least one-half with\\neach recursive call. Speciﬁcally, from the deﬁnition of mid, the number of remain-\\ning candidates is either\\n(mid−1)−low+1=/floorleftbigglow+high\\n2/floorrightbigg\\n−low≤high−low+1\\n2\\nor\\nhigh−(mid+1)+1=high−/floorleftbigglow+high\\n2/floorrightbigg\\n≤high−low+1\\n2.\\nInitially, the number of candidates is n; after the ﬁrst call in a binary search, it is\\nat most n/2; after the second call, it is at most n/4; and so on. In general, after\\nthe jthcall in a binary search, the number of candidate elements remaining is at\\nmost n/2j. In the worst case (an unsuccessful search), the recursive calls stop when\\nthere are no more candidate elements. Hence, the maximum number of recursive\\ncalls performed, is the smallest integer rsuch thatn\\n2r<1.\\nIn other words (recalling that we omit a logarithm’s base when it is 2), ris the\\nsmallest integer such that r>logn. Thus, we have\\nr=⌊logn⌋+1,\\nwhich implies that binary search runs in O(logn)time.\\nComputing Disk Space Usage\\nOur ﬁnal recursive algorithm from Section 5.1 was that for computing the overall\\ndisk space usage in a speciﬁed portion of a ﬁle system. To characterize the “prob-lem size” for our analysis, we let ndenote the number of ﬁle-system entries in the\\nportion of the ﬁle system that is considered. (For example, the ﬁle system portrayed\\nin Figure 5.6 has n=19 entries.)\\nTo characterize the cumulative time spent for an initial call to diskUsage ,w e\\nmust analyze the total number of recursive invocations that are made, as well as thenumber of operations that are executed within those invocations.\\nWe begin by showing that there are precisely nrecursive invocations of the\\nmethod, in particular, one for each entry in the relevant portion of the ﬁle system.Intuitively, this is because a call to diskUsage for a particular entry eof the ﬁle\\nsystem is only made from within the for loop of Code Fragment 5.5 when process-ing the entry for the unique directory that contains e, and that entry will only be\\nexplored once.\\nwww.it-ebooks.info'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='5.2. Analyzing Recursive Algorithms 205\\nTo formalize this argument, we can deﬁne the nesting level of each entry such\\nthat the entry on which we begin has nesting level 0, entries stored directly within\\nit have nesting level 1, entries stored within those entries have nesting level 2, andso on. We can prove by induction that there is exactly one recursive invocation ofdiskUsage upon each entry at nesting level k. As a base case, when k=0, the only\\nrecursive invocation made is the initial one. As the inductive step, once we know\\nthere is exactly one recursive invocation for each entry at nesting level k, we can\\nclaim that there is exactly one invocation for each entry eat nesting level k+1,\\nmade within the for loop for the entry at level kthat contains e.\\nHaving established that there is one recursive call for each entry of the ﬁle\\nsystem, we return to the question of the overall computation time for the algorithm.\\nIt would be great if we could argue that we spend O(1)time in any single invocation\\nof the method, but that is not the case. While there is a constant number of stepsreﬂected in the call to root.length() to compute the disk usage directly at that entry,\\nwhen the entry is a directory, the body of the diskUsage method includes a for loop\\nthat iterates over all entries that are contained within that directory. In the worst\\ncase, it is possible that one entry includes n−1 others.\\nBased on this reasoning, we could conclude that there are O(n)recursive calls,\\neach of which runs in O(n)time, leading to an overall running time that is O(n\\n2).\\nWhile this upper bound is technically true, it is not a tight upper bound. Remark-ably, we can prove the stronger bound that the recursive algorithm for diskUsage\\ncompletes in O(n)time! The weaker bound was pessimistic because it assumed\\na worst-case number of entries for each directory. While it is possible that somedirectories contain a number of entries proportional to n, they cannot all contain\\nthat many. To prove the stronger claim, we choose to consider the overall number\\nof iterations of the for loop across all recursive calls. We claim there are precisely\\nn−1 such iterations of that loop overall. We base this claim on the fact that each\\niteration of that loop makes a recursive call to diskUsage , and yet we have already\\nconcluded that there are a total of ncalls todiskUsage (including the original call).\\nWe therefore conclude that there are O(n)recursive calls, each of which uses O(1)\\ntime outside the loop, and that the overall number of operations due to the loop\\nisO(n). Summing all of these bounds, the overall number of operations is O(n).\\nThe argument we have made is more advanced than with the earlier examples\\nof recursion. The idea that we can sometimes get a tighter bound on a series ofoperations by considering the cumulative effect, rather than assuming that each\\nachieves a worst case is a technique called amortization ; we will see another ex-\\nample of such analysis in Section 7.2.3. Furthermore, a ﬁle system is an implicitexample of a data structure known as a tree, and our disk usage algorithm is really\\na manifestation of a more general algorithm known as a tree traversal . Trees will\\nbe the focus of Chapter 8, and our argument about the O(n)running time of the\\ndisk usage algorithm will be generalized for tree traversals in Section 8.4.\\nwww.it-ebooks.info'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='206 Chapter 5. Recursion\\n5.3 Further Examples of Recursion\\nIn this section, we provide additional examples of the use of recursion. We organize\\nour presentation by considering the maximum number of recursive calls that maybe started from within the body of a single activation.\\n•If a recursive call starts at most one other, we call this a linear recursion .\\n•If a recursive call may start two others, we call this a binary recursion .\\n•If a recursive call may start three or more others, this is multiple recursion .\\n5.3.1 Linear Recursion\\nIf a recursive method is designed so that each invocation of the body makes at\\nmost one new recursive call, this is know as linear recursion . Of the recursions\\nwe have seen so far, the implementation of the factorial method (Section 5.1.1) is aclear example of linear recursion. More interestingly, the binary search algorithm(Section 5.1.3) is also an example of linear recursion , despite the term “binary”\\nin the name. The code for binary search (Code Fragment 5.3) includes a case\\nanalysis, with two branches that lead to a further recursive call, but only one branch\\nis followed during a particular execution of the body.\\nA consequence of the deﬁnition of linear recursion is that any recursion trace\\nwill appear as a single sequence of calls, as we originally portrayed for the factorialmethod in Figure 5.1 of Section 5.1.1. Note that the linear recursion terminol-\\nogy reﬂects the structure of the recursion trace, not the asymptotic analysis of the\\nrunning time; for example, we have seen that binary search runs in O(logn)time.\\nSumming the Elements of an Array Recursively\\nLinear recursion can be a useful tool for processing a sequence, such as a Java array.\\nSuppose, for example, that we want to compute the sum of an array of nintegers.\\nWe can solve this summation problem using linear recursion by observing that if\\nn=0 the sum is trivially 0, and otherwise it is the sum of the ﬁrst n−1i n t e g e r si n\\nthe array plus the last value in the array.

Our recursion for an-\\nalyzing the disk space usage of a ﬁle system (see Section 5.1.4) is an example of\\nmultiple recursion, because the number of recursive calls made during one invoca-tion was equal to the number of entries within a given directory of the ﬁle system.\\nAnother common application of multiple recursion is when we want to enumer-\\nate various conﬁgurations in order to solve a combinatorial puzzle. For example,\\nthe following are all instances of what are known as summation puzzles :\\npot+pan = bib\\ndog+cat = pig\\nboy+girl = baby\\nTo solve such a puzzle, we need to assign a unique digit (that is, 0 ,1,..., 9) to each\\nletter in the equation, in order to make the equation true. Typically, we solve sucha puzzle by using our human observations of the particular puzzle we are trying tosolve to eliminate conﬁgurations (that is, possible partial assignments of digits to\\nletters) until we can work through the feasible conﬁgurations that remain, testing\\nfor the correctness of each one.\\nIf the number of possible conﬁgurations is not too large, however, we can use\\na computer to simply enumerate all the possibilities and test each one, without em-ploying any human observations. Such an algorithm can use multiple recursion\\nto work through the conﬁgurations in a systematic way. To keep the description\\ngeneral enough to be used with other puzzles, we consider an algorithm that enu-merates and tests all k-length sequences, without repetitions, chosen from a given\\nuniverse U.

Recursion\\n5.4 Designing Recursive Algorithms\\nAn algorithm that uses recursion typically has the following form:\\n•Test for base cases. We begin by testing for a set of base cases (there should\\nbe at least one). These base cases should be deﬁned so that every possible\\nchain of recursive calls will eventually reach a base case, and the handling of\\neach base case should not use recursion.\\n•Recur. If not a base case, we perform one or more recursive calls. This recur-\\nsive step may involve a test that decides which of several possible recursive\\ncalls to make. We should deﬁne each possible recursive call so that it makes\\nprogress towards a base case.\\nParameterizing a Recursion\\nTo design a recursive algorithm for a given problem, it is useful to think of thedifferent ways we might deﬁne subproblems that have the same general structure\\nas the original problem. If one has difﬁculty ﬁnding the repetitive structure needed\\nto design a recursive algorithm, it is sometimes useful to work out the problem ona few concrete examples to see how the subproblems should be deﬁned.\\nA successful recursive design sometimes requires that we redeﬁne the origi-\\nnal problem to facilitate similar-looking subproblems. Often, this involved repa-rameterizing the signature of the method. For example, when performing a bi-\\nnary search in an array, a natural method signature for a caller would appear as\\nbinarySearch(data, target) . However, in Section 5.1.3, we deﬁned our method\\nwith calling signature binarySearch(data, target, low, high) , using the additional\\nparameters to demarcate subarrays as the recursion proceeds. This change in pa-\\nrameterization is critical for binary search. Several other examples in this chapter\\n(e.g.,reverseArray ,linearSum ,binarySum ) also demonstrated the use of additional\\nparameters in deﬁning recursive subproblems.\\nIf we wish to provide a cleaner public interface to an algorithm without expos-\\ning the user to the recursive parameterization, a standard technique is to make therecursive version private, and to introduce a cleaner public method (that calls the\\nprivate one with appropriate parameters). For example, we might offer the follow-\\ning simpler version of binarySearch for public use:\\n/∗∗Returns true if the target value is found in the data array. ∗/\\npublic static boolean binarySearch( int[ ] data, inttarget){\\nreturnbinarySearch(data, target, 0, data.length −1);// use parameterized version\\n}\\nwww.it-ebooks.info'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='5.5.

To analyze the problem, we let ndenote\\nthe number of entries under consideration, that is, let n=1+h i g h −low.\\nIfn=1, then the running time of unique3 isO(1), since there are no recursive\\ncalls for this case. In the general case, the important observation is that a single calltounique3 for a problem of size nmay result in two recursive calls on problems of\\nsize n−1. Those two calls with size n−1 could in turn result in four calls (two\\neach) with a range of size n−2, and thus eight calls with size n−3 and so on.\\nThus, in the worst case, the total number of method calls is given by the geometricsummation\\n1+2+4+···+2\\nn−1,\\nw h i c hi se q u a lt o2n−1 by Proposition 4.5.

An inﬁnite recursion\\ncan quickly swamp computing resources, not only due to rapid use of the CPU,\\nbut because each successive call creates a frame requiring additional memory.

Had that line instead been written as\\nreturnbinarySearch(data, target, mid, high); // sending mid, not mid+1\\nthis could result in an inﬁnite recursion. In particular, when searching a range of\\ntwo elements, it becomes possible to make a recursive call on the identical range.\\nA programmer should ensure that each recursive call is in some way progress-\\ning toward a base case (for example, by having a parameter value that decreases\\nwith each call). To combat against inﬁnite recursions, the designers of Java madean intentional decision to limit the overall space used to store activation framesfor simultaneously active method calls. If this limit is reached, the Java Virtual\\nMachine throws a StackOverﬂowError . (We will further discuss the “stack” data\\nstructure in Section 6.1.) The precise value of this limit depends upon the Javainstallation, but a typical value might allow upward of 1000 simultaneous calls.\\nFor many applications of recursion, allowing up to 1000 nested calls sufﬁces.\\nFor example, our binarySearch method (Section 5.1.3) has O(logn)recursive depth,\\nand so for the default recursive limit to be reached, there would need to be 2\\n1000\\nelements (far, far more than the estimated number of atoms in the universe).

Eliminating Tail Recursion 219\\n5.6 Eliminating Tail Recursion\\nThe main beneﬁt of a recursive approach to algorithm design is that it allows us to\\nsuccinctly take advantage of a repetitive structure present in many problems. Bymaking our algorithm description exploit the repetitive structure in a recursive way,we can often avoid complex case analyses and nested loops. This approach can\\nlead to more readable algorithm descriptions, while still being quite efﬁcient.\\nHowever, the usefulness of recursion comes at a modest cost. In particular,\\nthe Java Virtual Machine must maintain frames that keep track of the state of each\\nnested call. When computer memory is at a premium, it can be beneﬁcial to derive\\nnonrecursive implementations of recursive algorithms.\\nIn general, we can use the stack data structure, which we will introduce in\\nSection 6.1, to convert a recursive algorithm into a nonrecursive algorithm by man-\\naging the nesting of the recursive structure ourselves, rather than relying on theinterpreter to do so. Although this only shifts the memory usage from the inter-preter to our stack, we may be able to further reduce the memory usage by storingthe minimal information necessary.\\nEven better, some forms of recursion can be eliminated without any use of aux-\\niliary memory. One such form is known as tail recursion . A recursion is a tail\\nrecursion if any recursive call that is made from one context is the very last opera-\\ntion in that context, with the return value of the recursive call (if any) immediately\\nreturned by the enclosing recursion. By necessity, a tail recursion must be a lin-ear recursion (since there is no way to make a second recursive call if you mustimmediately return the result of the ﬁrst).\\nOf the recursive methods demonstrated in this chapter, the binarySearch method\\nof Code Fragment 5.3 and the reverseArray method of Code Fragment 5.7 are ex-\\namples of tail recursion. Several others of our linear recursions are almost liketail recursion, but not technically so. For example, our factorial method of Code\\nFragment 5.1 is nota tail recursion. It concludes with the command:\\nreturnn∗factorial(n −1);\\nThis is not a tail recursion because an additional multiplication is performed after\\nthe recursive call is completed, and the result returned is not the same. For similar\\nreasons, the linearSum method of Code Fragment 5.6, both power methods from\\nCode Fragments 5.8 and 5.9, and the ﬁbonacciGood method of Code Fragment 5.13\\nfail to be tail recursions.\\nTail recursions are special, as they can be automatically reimplemented nonre-\\ncursively by enclosing the body in a loop for repetition, and replacing a recursivecall with new parameters by a reassignment of the existing parameters to thosevalues.

Recursion\\nOne way to describe repetition within a computer program is the use of loops,\\nsuch as Java’s while -loop and for-loop constructs described in Section 1.5.2. An\\nentirely different way to achieve repetition is through a process known as recursion .\\nRecursion is a technique by which a method makes one or more calls to itself\\nduring execution, or by which a data structure relies upon smaller instances of\\nthe very same type of structure in its representation. There are many examples ofrecursion in art and nature. For example, fractal patterns are naturally recursive. Aphysical example of recursion used in art is in the Russian Matryoshka dolls. Each\\ndoll is either made of solid wood, or is hollow and contains another Matryoshka\\ndoll inside it.\\nIn computing, recursion provides an elegant and powerful alternative for per-'), Document(metadata={'start_index': 758}, page_content='doll inside it.\\nIn computing, recursion provides an elegant and powerful alternative for per-\\nforming repetitive tasks. In fact, a few programming languages (e.g., Scheme,Smalltalk) do not explicitly support looping constructs and instead rely directlyon recursion to express repetition. Most modern programming languages supportfunctional recursion using the identical mechanism that is used to support tradi-\\ntional forms of method calls. When one invocation of the method makes a recursive\\ncall, that invocation is suspended until the recursive call completes.\\nRecursion is an important technique in the study of data structures and algo-\\nrithms. We will use it prominently in several later chapters of this book (mostnotably, Chapters 8 and 12).

Recursive algo-\\nrithms are widely used to explore and manage these ﬁle systems.\\nWe then describe how to perform a formal analysis of the running time of a\\nrecursive algorithm, and we discuss some potential pitfalls when deﬁning recur-sions.

Illustrative Examples 191\\n5.1 Illustrative Examples\\n5.1.1 The Factorial Function\\nTo demonstrate the mechanics of recursion, we begin with a simple mathematical\\nexample of computing the value of the factorial function . The factorial of a posi-\\ntive integer n, denoted n!, is deﬁned as the product of the integers from 1 to n.I f\\nn=0, then n! is deﬁned as 1 by convention. More formally, for any integer n≥0,\\nn!=/braceleftbigg1i f n=0\\nn·(n−1)·(n−2)···3·2·1i f n≥1.\\nFor example, 5! =5·4·3·2·1=120. The factorial function is important because\\nit is known to equal the number of ways in which ndistinct items can be arranged\\ninto a sequence, that is, the number of permutations ofnitems. For example, the\\nthree characters a,b,a n d ccan be arranged in 3! =3·2·1=6 ways: abc ,acb ,\\nbac ,bca ,cab ,a n d cba .\\nThere is a natural recursive deﬁnition for the factorial function.

First, we\\nhave one or more base cases , which refer to ﬁxed values of the function. The above\\ndeﬁnition has one base case stating that n!=1f o r n=0. Second, we have one\\nor more recursive cases , which deﬁne the function in terms of itself.

The process is ﬁnite because each\\ntime the method is invoked, its argument is smaller by one, and when a base case\\nis reached, no further recursive calls are made.\\nWe illustrate the execution of a recursive method using a recursion trace . Each\\nentry of the trace corresponds to a recursive call. Each new recursive method call\\nis indicated by a downward arrow to a new invocation. When the method returns,an arrow showing this return is drawn and the return value may be indicated along-side this arrow.

When computer memory is at a premium, it can be beneﬁcial to derive\\nnonrecursive implementations of recursive algorithms.\\nIn general, we can use the stack data structure, which we will introduce in\\nSection 6.1, to convert a recursive algorithm into a nonrecursive algorithm by man-'), Document(metadata={'start_index': 843}, page_content='Section 6.1, to convert a recursive algorithm into a nonrecursive algorithm by man-\\naging the nesting of the recursive structure ourselves, rather than relying on theinterpreter to do so. Although this only shifts the memory usage from the inter-preter to our stack, we may be able to further reduce the memory usage by storingthe minimal information necessary.\\nEven better, some forms of recursion can be eliminated without any use of aux-\\niliary memory. One such form is known as tail recursion . A recursion is a tail\\nrecursion if any recursive call that is made from one context is the very last opera-\\ntion in that context, with the return value of the recursive call (if any) immediately\\nreturned by the enclosing recursion. By necessity, a tail recursion must be a lin-ear recursion (since there is no way to make a second recursive call if you mustimmediately return the result of the ﬁrst).\\nOf the recursive methods demonstrated in this chapter, the binarySearch method'), Document(metadata={'start_index': 1743}, page_content='Of the recursive methods demonstrated in this chapter, the binarySearch method\\nof Code Fragment 5.3 and the reverseArray method of Code Fragment 5.7 are ex-\\namples of tail recursion. Several others of our linear recursions are almost liketail recursion, but not technically so. For example, our factorial method of Code\\nFragment 5.1 is nota tail recursion. It concludes with the command:\\nreturnn∗factorial(n −1);\\nThis is not a tail recursion because an additional multiplication is performed after\\nthe recursive call is completed, and the result returned is not the same. For similar\\nreasons, the linearSum method of Code Fragment 5.6, both power methods from\\nCode Fragments 5.8 and 5.9, and the ﬁbonacciGood method of Code Fragment 5.13\\nfail to be tail recursions.\\nTail recursions are special, as they can be automatically reimplemented nonre-'), Document(metadata={'start_index': 2509}, page_content='Tail recursions are special, as they can be automatically reimplemented nonre-\\ncursively by enclosing the body in a loop for repetition, and replacing a recursivecall with new parameters by a reassignment of the existing parameters to thosevalues.
